    <h2>SharpLync Secure Remote Support Policy</h2>
    <p>
        At SharpLync, your security is our highest priority. We use industry-leading, secure remote access tools to 
        provide efficient support. We understand that these same tools can be exploited by malicious actors 
        (scammers). This document outlines our strict protocol to ensure your safety and give you absolute 
        confidence that you are connecting only with an authenticated SharpLync representative.

    <h2>1. Our Commitment to Your Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take customer security and the integrity of our support process extremely seriously. We have implemented 
        several clear, non-negotiable procedures that we will follow on every single remote support call. If any person 
        claiming to be from SharpLync deviates from this protocol, you must immediately terminate the call.
    </p>

<div class="policy-section">
    <h2>2. The Two-Way Identity Verification Protocol</h2>
    <p>
        To ensure absolute security, we use a two-step verification process where you, the customer, confirm our identity 
        first. This requires your Personal Verification PIN, which is confidential and known only to you and SharpLync's 
        secure system.
    </p>

    <p>Before we proceed with any remote connection or sensitive discussion, the following mandatory steps must occur:</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">Customer Requests PIN (The Challenge)</h3>
    <p>You, the customer, must ask the SharpLync technician to provide your confidential Personal Verification PIN.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">SharpLync Provides Customer PIN (The Proof)</h3>
    <p>The technician will read back this exact PIN from your secure account record.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">Customer Verifies Identity (The Veto)</h3>
    <p>
        You must confirm that the PIN provided by the technician matches your Personal Verification PIN. If the PIN does 
        not match, you must immediately hang up.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">Forward Identification (Session PIN)</h3>
    <p>
        Once our identity is confirmed, the technician will then provide a unique, time-sensitive Session PIN which is 
        required to start the actual remote connection software.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">Connection Only After Verification</h3>
    <p>
        We will only begin the remote connection process once both the Personal Verification PIN (Step 3) and the 
        Session PIN (Step 4) are successfully verified.
    </p>

    <p><strong>You identify us first</strong>, using a secret only you and our secure system know. This guarantees our authenticity.</p>

    <h2>4. What To Do If You Suspect a Scam</h2>
    <p>

        cash withdrawal) or pressures you to provide banking details or open financial websites:

    <h2>5. Building Trust Through Transparency and Control</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">A. Clear Access Scope and Tools</h3>
    <p>
        Tools Used: We currently use professional, encrypted remote desktop solutions such as TeamViewer. These 
        tools are secure, but we understand their names are sometimes misused by scammers. Always refer to Section 2 
        for identity verification first.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>One-Time Access:</strong> The Session PIN provided in Section 2 ensures a one-time, session-only 
        connection. Once the session is closed, the technician cannot reconnect unless a new, unique Session PIN is 
        granted by you. We do not install permanent, unattended access without your explicit, separate, written consent.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">B. Customer Control and Monitoring</h3>
    <p><strong>Watch Our Every Move:</strong> You must stay at your computer and monitor the screen while the remote session is active. Our technicians will verbally explain every major action they take.</p>
    <p><strong>Terminate Anytime:</strong> You can terminate the remote connection immediately at any time by simply closing the remote control software window or using the disconnect button. If you feel uncomfortable, disconnect and call us back.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">C. Session Logging and Privacy</h3>
    <p><strong>Session Records:</strong> For quality assurance, security, and dispute resolution, all remote support sessions are video recorded and logged.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Our technicians are strictly prohibited from viewing or copying your personal files unless directed by you as part of a troubleshooting task. We adhere to our comprehensive Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">D. Post-Session Protocol</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Guaranteed Disconnect:</strong> Upon completion of the support session, the SharpLync technician will confirm the session 
        has been securely terminated and will verify that the temporary access link has expired.
    </p>
