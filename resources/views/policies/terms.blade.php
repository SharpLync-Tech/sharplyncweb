    <h2>2. Provision of Services</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Scope of Services</h3>
    <p>
        SharpLync agrees to provide the information technology services ("Services") strictly as 
        described in the mutually agreed-upon SOW or Quote. Any additional or varied work 
        requires a written variation signed by both parties and may incur extra fees.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Service Standards and Consumer Guarantees</h3>
    <p><strong>Due Care and Skill:</strong> SharpLync will perform the Services with due care and skill and 
        within a reasonable time.</p>

    <p><strong>Fitness for Purpose:</strong> The Services will be reasonably fit for any purpose expressly 
        disclosed by You and agreed to by Us in writing.</p>

    <p><strong>Australian Consumer Law (ACL):</strong> Nothing in these Terms excludes rights under the ACL 
        or other non-excludable laws. Liability for ACL breaches is limited to resupplying the 
        Services or paying resupply costs, to the extent permitted.

    <h2>3. Customer Responsibilities and Data Management</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Necessary Access and Cooperation</h3>
    <p>
        You must provide timely, accurate information, access to premises, systems, 
        equipment, and personnel as required. Delays from Your non-compliance may extend 
        timelines and incur additional charges at Our standard rates.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Customer Responsibility for Security and Data Backup</h3>
    <p>
        You are solely responsible for Your systems' security and data backups, including 
        compliance with Australian cyber security laws (e.g., Cyber Security Act 2024 (Cth)).
    </p>

    <p><strong>Security:</strong> Maintain up-to-date anti-virus, firewalls, and access controls. SharpLync 
        disclaims liability for breaches due to Your failures.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Backup:</strong> Unless a separate managed backup SOW exists, You handle all backups. 
        SharpLync is not liable for data loss, corruption, or disclosure except for Our gross 
        negligence or willful misconduct, proven by You.</p>

    <h2>4. Financial Terms</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Fees and Payment</h3>
    <p>
        Pay fees as per the SOW or Quote by the invoice due date. Overdue amounts accrue 
        interest at 1.5% per month or the maximum lawful rate. All fees are exclusive of GST.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Suspension and Collection</h3>
    <p>
        We may suspend Services for non-payment after 7 days' notice, without breaching 
        these Terms. You reimburse Our collection costs, including legal fees.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 Retention of Title (Hardware) and PPSA</h3>
    <p><strong>Retention of Title (ROT) and PMSI:</strong> Notwithstanding delivery, the title (legal 
        ownership) of any hardware, equipment, or goods supplied, resold, or installed by 
        SharpLync to the Customer (the "Goods") remains vested in SharpLync and does not pass 
        to the Customer until the full price for those specific Goods and all other amounts owing 
        by the Customer to SharpLync have been paid in full. This ROT constitutes a security 
        interest and specifically a Purchase Money Security Interest (PMSI) under the PPSA.</p>

    <p><strong>Risk:</strong> The risk of loss or damage to the Goods passes to the Customer upon 
        delivery or installation.</p>

    <p><strong>Storage and Resale:</strong> Until payment is made, the Customer must store the Goods 
        separately, ensuring they are clearly identified as the property of SharpLync. The 
        Customer must not sell, lease, or dispose of the Goods unless agreed to in writing by 
        SharpLync.</p>

    <p><strong>Repossession:</strong> If payment is not made by the due date or the Customer becomes 
        insolvent, SharpLync may, without notice and without prejudice to any other rights, 
        enter the Customer's premises (or any premises where the Goods are reasonably 
        believed to be located) to repossess and resell the Goods. The Customer indemnifies 
        SharpLync for any damage caused during repossession, provided such damage is not 
        caused by Our gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>

    <p><strong>PPSA Acknowledgement and Waiver:</strong> The Customer acknowledges and agrees 
        that SharpLync may register its security interest (including the PMSI) in the Goods and 
        the proceeds thereof on the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR). The Customer 
        waives its right to receive any notice under the PPSA, including, but not limited to, a 
        notice of verification statement under section 157 and a notice of enforcement event 
        under section 121(4)(b).</p>

    <p><strong>Contracting Out:</strong> The Customer and SharpLync agree to contract out of sections 
        142 and 143 of the PPSA (rights to redemption of collateral).</p>

    </p>

    <h3>6.2 Cap on Liability</h3>
    <p>
        Our total liability (in contract, tort, or otherwise) is limited to the fees You paid for the 
        relevant Services in the three (3) months preceding the claim, except for gross 
        negligence or willful misconduct.
    </p>

    <h3>6.3 Indemnity</h3>
    <p>
        You indemnify SharpLync, its officers, and agents against all claims, losses, liabilities, 
        costs (including legal fees on an indemnity basis), arising from:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>(a) Your misuse of Services;</li>
        <li>(b) Breaches of Your obligations (e.g., security, data);</li>
        <li>(c) Third-party claims from Your use, except to the extent caused by Our gross 
            negligence or willful misconduct.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        SharpLync provides limited indemnity to You solely for third-party IP infringement 
        claims arising directly from Our Services, up to the liability cap.
