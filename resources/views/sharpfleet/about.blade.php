    <h1>SharpFleet<br><span class="highlight">Our Story</span></h1>
    <p class="mb-0">
        SharpFleet didn’t start in a boardroom. It started with real businesses, real vehicles, and real frustration.
    </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">How it started</h3>
        <p>
            As an IT consultant working with small and medium businesses, I kept seeing the same problem again and again:
            companies were expected to manage vehicles and drivers using tools that were either overpriced, overcomplicated,
            or built for corporations with dedicated fleet managers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most businesses don’t want hardware installs, driver surveillance, or rigid systems that force them to change how they work.
            They just want a simple, reliable way to track vehicles, trips, servicing, and compliance — without the nonsense.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
            So SharpFleet was built to do exactly that.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Built for the real world</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">SharpFleet is designed for businesses that run:</p>
        <ul class="mb-3" style="margin:0; padding-left: 18px;">
            <li>cars, utes, vans</li>
            <li>trucks and machinery</li>
            <li>construction equipment</li>
            <li>marine vehicles like boats and jet skis</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-3">If it moves, gets serviced, and needs accountability — SharpFleet fits.</p>
        <ul class="mb-0" style="margin:0; padding-left: 18px;">
            <li>No GPS hardware.</li>
            <li>No lock-in contracts.</li>
            <li>No “enterprise-only” pricing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3 class="section-title">Why SharpFleet is different</h3>
        <p>
            SharpFleet focuses on day-to-day reality, not theory.
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-3" style="margin:0; padding-left: 18px;">
            <li>Some vehicles are pool vehicles</li>
            <li>Some are permanently assigned to managers</li>
            <li>Some are off the road for servicing</li>
            <li>Some are used for both business and private trips</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-0">
            SharpFleet supports all of that — because that’s how businesses actually operate.
            You control the rules. SharpFleet handles the tracking.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Built by someone who uses it</h3>
        <p>
            SharpFleet isn’t a generic SaaS product built by people who’ve never run a vehicle fleet.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">It’s built by someone who:</p>
        <ul class="mb-3" style="margin:0; padding-left: 18px;">
            <li>works directly with business owners</li>
            <li>understands compliance and audit pressure</li>
            <li>values simplicity over feature overload</li>
            <li>believes software should fit the business, not the other way around</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-0">
            The goal has always been simple: old-school common sense, backed by modern technology.
        </p>
    </div>

        <h3 class="section-title">The road ahead</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">SharpFleet is launching in 2026 with a clear focus:</p>
        <ul class="mb-3" style="margin:0; padding-left: 18px;">
            <li>small to medium businesses</li>
            <li>transparent pricing</li>
            <li>steady, practical improvements</li>
            <li>no gimmicks, no hardware upsells</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This isn’t about becoming the biggest fleet platform in the world.
            It’s about becoming the most sensible one.
        </p>
