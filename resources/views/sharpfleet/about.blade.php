        <!-- Story -->
        <p>
            I started my own business and needed to log business trips.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had two cars.<br>
            I was constantly swapping between them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Half the time the logbook wasn’t in the car I was driving.<br>
            And when it was, I couldn’t be bothered writing things down anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don’t like writing.<br>
            I don’t like trying to remember trips later.<br>
            And I really didn’t like that something so simple was already becoming a pain.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I built my own logbook — on my phone.<br>
            Something I knew would always be with me, no matter which car I was using.
        </p>

        <p>
            It started as a really basic tool just for me.<br>
            Something I could actually use without thinking about it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then I added a bit here and there as I needed it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Services.<br>
            Rego.<br>
            Vehicles.<br>
            Small improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
            As it grew, I realised something else:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Business owners should be the ones setting the rules.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Not software.<br>
            Not rigid systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I built SharpFleet to give business owners the tools,<br>
            and let them decide how strict or flexible they want to be.
        </p>

        <p>
            It wasn’t planned.<br>
            There was no big idea behind it.
        </p>

        <p>
            It just grew out of fixing a problem I didn’t want to deal with anymore.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top:24px;">
            That’s it. That’s how it started.<br>
            Now it’s available to you — set the rules for your business,<br>
            and let your drivers… well, drive 🚗
        </p>
