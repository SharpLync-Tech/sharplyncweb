            <h1>How SharpFleet<br><span class="highlight">Started</span></h1>
        </div>

        <p>I started my own business and needed to log business trips.</p>

        <p>
            I had two cars and was constantly swapping between them.
            Half the time the logbook wasn’t in the car I was driving, and when it was, I couldn’t be bothered writing things down anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hate writing.
            I hate trying to remember trips later.
            And I hated that something so simple was already becoming a pain.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I built my own logbook — on my phone — something I knew would always be with me, no matter which car I was using.
        </p>

        <p>
            It started as a really basic tool just for me, something I could actually use without thinking about it.
            Then I added a bit here and there as I needed it.
            Services. Rego. Vehicles. Small improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
            As it grew, I realised something else: business owners should be the ones setting the rules.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not software.
            Not rigid systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I built SharpFleet to give business owners the tools, and let them decide how strict or flexible they want to be.
        </p>

        <p>
            It wasn’t planned.
            There was no big idea behind it.
            It just grew out of fixing a problem I didn’t want to deal with anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
            That’s it. That’s how it started.
            Now it’s available to you — set the rules for your business, and let your drivers… well, drive.
